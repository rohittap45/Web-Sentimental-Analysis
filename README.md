\# URL Data Processor

This project is a Python script that fetches data from URLs, parses the text, performs sentiment and readability analysis, and creates structured output in CSV and Excel files. It is designed to process URLs from an input Excel file and generate various text-based metrics.

\## Features

\- Fetches data from a list of URLs.

\- Parses HTML content to extract article titles and text.

\- Performs sentiment analysis (positive, negative, and polarity scores).

\- Conducts readability analysis (complex words, syllables, and Fog index).

\- Outputs the results into structured CSV and Excel files.

\## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script requires Python 3.6 or higher.

\### Required Libraries

Install the required libraries using \`pip\`:

\`\`\`bash

pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas nltk grequests openpyxl

\`\`\`

\## Instructions to Run the Script

1\. \*\*Save the Script\*\*:

Save the provided Python script as \`data\_processing\_script.py\`.

2\. \*\*Prepare Input File\*\*:

Prepare an Excel file named \`Input.xlsx\` with a column named \`URL\` that contains the list of URLs to process. Place this file in the same directory as the Python script.

3\. \*\*Run the Script\*\*:

Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

\`\`\`bash

python data\_processing\_script.py

\`\`\`

4\. \*\*Check Output\*\*:

The script will generate a structured output file in both CSV and Excel formats in the specified directory.

\## Customization

\### Changing File Paths

\- Modify the \`file\_path\` variable in the script to set the directory where output files will be saved.

\- Update paths in the functions \`read\_stop\_words()\` and \`read\_positive\_negative\_words()\` to point to the location of the stop words and word lists on your system.

\- Adjust paths in the functions \`create\_dataframe()\` and \`get\_urls()\` to reflect the correct locations for input and output files.

\### Network Requirement

Make sure you have a stable high-speed internet connection as the script fetches data from URLs.

\## Input File Format

Ensure your \`Input.xlsx\` file follows this format:

| URL |

|------------------------------------|

| https://example.com/article1 |

| https://example.com/article2 |

The output will be saved as structured CSV and Excel files with sentiment and readability metrics.
